Q: What is The Bay?
A: A three-month online event to build four ~15-hour projects, spend ≥60 hours, and get at least one project to go viral.

Q: What are the requirements for The Bay?
A: Ship four fully deployed projects (live website or production app, open-source code on GitHub with a README), log ≥60 hours after the announcement date, and meet the viral threshold on one project.

Q: What counts as “going viral”?
A: Hitting the view/post thresholds defined here: https://shipwrecked.hackclub.com/info/go-viral.

Q: What happens if I log ≥60 hours but none of my projects go viral?
A: You’ll be wait-listed for Shipwrecked; spots freed up six weeks before the event go to the list in order. Viral projects guarantee a spot.

Q: Can I count work on a project I started before the event?
A: No. Only hours after the announcement count.

Q: Can I combine views across multiple platforms to meet viral thresholds?
A: No. You may only combine multiple posts on one platform in good faith.

Q: Must my projects be open source and usable by others?
A: Yes. Code must be on GitHub with a descriptive README.

Q: What qualifies as a shipped project?
A: A live website that stays up after the event or an app in production.

Q: Can I submit a project that’s entered in another event?
A: No.

Q: When do hours start counting?
A: From the event announcement date.
