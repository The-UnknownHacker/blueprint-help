# Shipwrecked - Hack Club Event

## What is Hack Club?
Hack Club is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization whose mission is to foster a wholesome generation of coders, makers, founders, and builders. Hack Club is a network of hundreds of student-led computer science clubs and a safe, positive online community of over 50,000 high school makers from around the world. Hack Club programs are free and accessible to all students. We support teenagers in making real projects in the real world.

## What is Shipwrecked?
Shipwrecked is a once-in-a-lifetime, four-day flagship hackathon on Cathleen Stone Island in the Boston Harbor. It's a story-based hackathon where participants are invited to build creative projects inspired by the idea of being shipwrecked.

**Dates**: August 8-11, 2025
**Location**: Cathleen Stone Island in the Boston Harbor
**Format**: 4-day immersive hackathon experience with story-based challenges

As soon as you arrive, you'll work together with 130 other hackers to "survive" on the island you've been stranded on. Everyone will work in smaller groups to complete quests, which will be centered around interacting with the world around you: helping island dwellers develop software/hardware projects, helping pirates plan routes more effectively, or building projects to help your fellow shipwreck-mates organize efforts more effectively. (This is a fictional scenario, similar to a Dungeons & Dragons adventure!)
